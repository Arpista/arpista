      A few links that I felt would be of potential interest to anyone
      interested in writing fiction and/or self-publishing.

      I cannot recommend this enough. Useful information for any would-be
      author, and I suspect quite a lot of practiced authors as well. Also
      editors, beta-readers, and practically anyone interested in the art and
      science of writing.

      For anyone who is not familiar with it, this can be a good place to find
      cover artists; while the quality varies, quite a number of remarkably good
      artists can be found there, and many of them may be willing to do
      commissions or license their work. Warning: the adult content filter does
      not always work.

      For anyone interested in publishing short stories, this site will let you
      search for places accepting the kind of story you’ve written (or are
      interested in writing), and give you useful information about them such as
      how much they pay and how long, on average, they take to get back to you.
      I recommend the Advanced Search.
