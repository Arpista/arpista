    <p>
      If you’d like me to look at something, please
      <a href="mailto: rebeccaanne3@gmail.com">email </a>it to me at
      rebeccaanne3@gmail.com. Questions or proposals are also welcome. I am not
      presently taking hard copies; if you feel strongly about it, feel free to
      email and we can talk, but I prefer to be able to give detailed commentary
      as needed and that works better with virtual paper, which has infinite
      margins.

      If you’ve already had me look at something (more than five pages, or more
      than once) and want to know how to pay me, I am happy with either a check,
      mailed to
