    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>
      My specialty is editing fiction, specifically science fiction and fantasy.
      I could also edit mysteries, thrillers, and literary nonfiction. I am
      happy to edit romances, but do not accept erotica; if you are curious
      about where the distinction lies, please email me. I would be happy to
      edit/give comments on brief essays, short stories or books, serialized
      novels and so on. I have no preference for print content over online. I do
      not accept PhD theses, college papers, etc.; while I have studied the
      rules of academic writing and done well as a student in an academic
      institution, academic writing is <i>not</i> my specialty. I edit only in
      English, although if you want brief Italian → English translations you
      should let me know.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a default, I will provide comments on content, style, and typos. I
      would prefer to give all three; if you only want one or two of the above,
      please contact me and we can discuss it, but I am somewhat uncomfortable
      with the idea of <i>not</i> notifying a client of important problems if I
      notice them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, my default style of feedback is to return your manuscript with
      detailed notes and comments – “You used ‘beautiful’ six times in the last
      two sentences; you may want to find a different word or describe
      <i>how</i> the thing/person is beautiful in more detail” “I don’t
      understand why this character is taking this action.” “ ‘It’s’ means ‘it
      is’; ‘its’ means ‘belonging to it’. I think you want ‘it’s’ here” – rather
      than simply rewriting your manuscript for you. After all, I may not be
      right about what you meant, or you may prefer a different solution to the
      problem than the one I would suggest. If you would prefer a different
      style of feedback, again, please contact me and let me know – I can adjust
      my style somewhat to suit your preferences. And if you have strong
      preferences about any aspect of feedback – for example, explicit
      suggestions for fixes versus no explicit suggestions for fixes – simply
      let me know, so that I can adjust my feedback into the form most helpful
      for you!
    </p>
    <p>
      I would prefer submissions in electronic format, ideally .odt, .doc or
      .docx. Please do not send me PDFs. My default is to use the comment
      function in common software such as OpenOffice to mark specific points
      that need correction, and to also send you a separate document with
      overall comments on plot/characters/grammar that are not specific to any
      one point in the document.
    </p>
    <h2>Pricing</h2>
    <p>
      I have a range of prices, depending on how much work your document
      requires (see below). For a first-time customer, I will provide a free
      copy-edit for the first five pages (~2500 words, since pages aren’t always
      consistent), so you can get an idea of what you’re buying; when I return
      those pages, I will also tell you what category your document falls into
      so you can decide whether you want to have the rest edited at that price.
      This offer does not apply to non-fiction which is 2500 words or fewer in
      total. For a second-time customer, just send me the document and I’ll send
      you back which category ASAP (I should know pretty much immediately.)
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE:&nbsp;<em>Please do not request a specific level.&nbsp;</em>The
      variable pricing is based on how much of my time it takes to produce a
      document with all the issues pointed out – if it takes two days, I’m not
      giving you the price for a document that takes five hours, and vice versa
      – though it’s nice of you to offer!
    </p>
    <p>The five categories are defined below:</p>
    <p><strong>Fiction</strong></p>
    <p>
      Light Editing Required– $2.00/500 words (approximately equivalent to one
      page, Times New Roman, 12 point font).
    </p>
    <p>
      Light means that your manuscript is close to ready to publish! It will
      usually have an average of no more than 10 comments/page, with occasional
      exceptions. A given page may go as high as 20-25 comments, or as low as
      none. I can probably return light work at a rate of 10 pages a day or
      higher, given no concurrent projects.
    </p>
    <p>Medium Editing Required – $4/500 words.</p>
    <p>
      Medium means that your manuscript will usually have an average of no more
      than 10-20 comments/page, with occasional exceptions. A given page may go
      as high as 25-30 comments, or as low as 5. I can probably return medium
      work at a rate of 5-8 pages a day or higher, given no concurrent projects.
    </p>
    <p>Heavy Editing Required – $8/500 words.</p>
    <p>
      Heavy means that your manuscript will usually have an average of 20+
      comments/page. Heavy-work manuscripts may be returned at 4-5 pages a day
      or fewer. I’m not going to lie to you – heavy means that it takes a
      <i>lot </i>of work. But on the bright side, you will get a lot of useful
      commentary out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At my discretion, non-fiction may occasionally qualify for the fiction
      price selection. This will&nbsp;<em>only occur&nbsp;</em>if the
      non-fiction is sufficiently entertaining to read to be, in that respect,
      equivalent to fiction. Don’t count on it. Possible examples of such
      non-fiction would include a history book meant to be read for fun, or an
      economics text ditto. Menus, theses, and commercial webpages need not
      apply.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Non-Fiction</strong></p>
    <p>
      Books or Articles – $12/500 words for lighter editing, or $16/500 words
      for heavy editing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Websites, menus, etc. – $16/500 words + $15 flat cost for the setup. While
      with most projects I am willing to eat the non per-page costs, that stops
      working on very brief documents, and I end up doing quite a lot of work
      for sixteen dollars. So all very brief documents in this category will
      have an extra $15 charge.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Additional Passes</strong></p>
    <p>
      Given that reading through something that I have already seen once is much
      quicker and easier, I only charge half price for successive full
      revisions; minor revisions along the lines of “does this paragraph fix the
      problem” do not need charging for. Precise due dates will need to be
      negotiated for any given project based on my schedule at that point (ie,
      whether I have other projects/commitments) and on how urgently you need it
      done. I would prefer to finish editing the entire manuscript and then
      return it to you, since this allows me to check for errors in chapter two
      that are not clearly errors until you read chapter sixteen, but if you are
      in a hurry I can also return your manuscript in sections (based on number
      of pages, internal divisions such as chapters, or whatever works for you)
      as I complete them. I am prepared to do multiple revisions and to work
      with you on specific problem spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      I accept payment either via PayPal or via a check mailed to
      <router-link to="/contact">my address</router-link>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: Terms and prices may be subject to change over time; however,
      preexisting commissions will not be affected.
