    <p>
      I started editing things for friends and family in my mid-teens, including
      two novels of my father’s (<a
        title="Harald"
        href="http://www.amazon.com/Harald-ebook/dp/B00BEQP2Y8/"
        ><i>Harald</i></a
      >
      and
      <a
        title="Salamander"
        href="http://www.amazon.com/Salamander-ebook/dp/B004TBD3Z0/"
        ><i>Salamander</i></a
      >; the former is commercially published, the latter self-published) and
      one commercially published non-fiction book (<a
        title="Future Imperfect"
        href="http://www.amazon.com/Future-Imperfect-Technology-Uncertain-ebook/dp/B001GCUCLS/"
        ><i>Future Imperfect</i></a
      >), as well as numerous short stories and some essays by various friends,
      none as of yet published. I have been working as a professional editor
      since 2015, with a focus on science fiction and fantasy novels, though I
      have also edited mysteries and miscellaneous shorter works. I am a
      graduate of the University of Chicago, with a BA in Romance Languages and
      Literatures; what that means in practice is that I can read medieval and
      renaissance Italian comfortably and have a rough familiarity with Italian
      Literature, especially medieval. I also have significant familiarity with
      modern American and British fantasy and science fiction, as well as some
      mysteries (one of my primary reasons to be an editor is to turn something
      I’ve always loved doing into a profession), so I am familiar with many of
      the conventions and ideas implicit in those genres. Ultimately, however,
      my work should speak for itself – hence the five free pages.
